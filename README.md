# Introduction
This project was done by Francisco José Pujalte Ferrándiz. It is the final project of my studies in The Bridge Bootcamp in Data Science.

# Background
The film industry, with its rich and intricate history, spans over a century of storytelling and technological advancements. As a multi-billion dollar global enterprise, it produces a diverse range of cinematic works, from blockbuster hits to independent films. Despite careful planning and substantial investments, predicting a movie’s success remains a challenging endeavor. Some films achieve remarkable success, captivating audiences and generating significant profits, while others, even with star-studded casts and high production values, unexpectedly fail at the box office.

# Scope
In this project, the scope is to build a Machine Learning prediction model in order to predict revenues depending on the features of the movie. Using streamlit, features as budget, duration, cast, crew, language, countries, genres or even companies can be chosen. All the features were analyzed thoroughly, looking for missing data, modified, and an exploratory data analysis was performed before the model training.

# Data
The data was extracted from this Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction, working with the train.csv file, which contains more than 3000 movies and their respective data.

# Structure
In Box_Office_Prediction_Model.ipynb, we can find the final memory for the project, summarizing all the procedures and tries performed to get to the final result. The structure of folders consist on: data (contain the csv files for the challenge), img (images), streamlit (.py files to run the streamlit interface locally, and another img folder inside), imports (all the models and dictionaries imported to build the interface), and finally, notebooks (three Jupyter notebooks in which I worked during these 2 weeks).

Thank you for your attention, and I hope you enjoy reading this project as much as I enjoyed doing it!
