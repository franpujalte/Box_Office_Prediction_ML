# Introduction
This project was done in its entirity by Francisco José Pujalte Ferrándiz. It is the final project of my studies in The Bridge Bootcamp in Data Science.

# Background
The film industry, with its rich and intricate history, spans over a century of storytelling and technological advancements. As a multi-billion dollar global enterprise, it produces a diverse range of cinematic works, from blockbuster hits to independent films. Despite careful planning and substantial investments, predicting a movie’s success remains a challenging endeavor. Some films achieve remarkable success, captivating audiences and generating significant profits, while others, even with star-studded casts and high production values, unexpectedly fail at the box office.

# Scope
In this project, the scope is to build a Machine Learning prediction model in order to predict revenues depending on the features of the movie. Using streamlit, features as budget, duration, cast, crew, language, countries, genres or even companies can be chosen. All the features were analyzed thoroughly, looking for missing data, modified, and an exploratory data analysis was performed before the model training.

# Data
The data was extracted from this Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction
